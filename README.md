## What I have learned in parts one and two of Project 1, "The Scriptures, Mapped"

Throughout these two walkthroughs, I better learned how it comes together as one. Thus
concepts, principles, and syntax of correct JavaScript coding. However, this walkthrough
far in this course, we have done several homework assignments and studied specific
better helped me put it all together and see it come to fruition in a project format.

I enjoyed pulling data from the API's in JSON format and am excited to work with this
data to visualize the mappings. Walking through the process also solidified the difference
between public and private functions while working with our JavaScript object, "Scriptures."

Another fun learning experience was switching all functions to arrow functions (as seen
in the example below):

Function            init function(callback) {}
Arrow Function      init = (callback) => {}

One of the parts I am still not certain on is the callback object. This object is passed
through several functions including "init" and "cacheBooks." I messed around with the 
callback object in the browser inspect window and will continue to learn more about this
object on YouTube and as we go forward with the project.
