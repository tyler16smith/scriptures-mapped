# Project 2: The Scriptures Mapped (CSS and UX)

### My Experience

I thoroughly enjoyed this project. Designing the user interface was like painting a canvas. It takes art, vision, and connecting with the user in order to make the interface interactive, user-friendly, and simple. The front-end user experience is often what makes or breaks the user's decisions to stick with the program or move on.

One of the biggest lessons I learned from doing this project was the amount of resources out there to help you with whatever you are trying to do. Chances are very likely that someone else has already done it and has posted their solution on the web for you to customize in your program. For creating the breadcrumbs, I simply google "breadcrumb navigation css" and found a wonderful solution on w3schools.com which I tailored to fit within our web application, learning new tools and skills along the way.

The second biggest lesson I learned was the importance of getting user feedback. About half-way through this project, my wife (a fellow software developer) commented on the colors, suggesting I change the background color of the navigation to match the background color of the Google map at that zoom level. I made the change and immediately felt a difference! When it comes to designing customer-facing applications, it's all about the customer experience. If I had more time, I would have gotten feedback from several potential customers.
