## What I have learned in Project 1, "The Scriptures, Mapped"

Throughout these two walkthroughs, I better learned how it all comes together as one. In
my programming experience thus far, I have never organized my functions with such tact and
order before this project. This project taught me much more than just correct JavaScript
principles; it taught me correct programming principles.

I have followed along with all of the videos and have gotten my program to work. The
finished product still has a long way to go until perfection, but I believe it is a good
representation of my many hours of effort and learning.

I enjoyed the process of slowly understanding what was going on. I didn't understand the
overall structure of the "Scriptures" function - specifically dealing with public and
private variables until the very end. I also enjoyed learning the Google Maps API. Luckily,
the documentation was excellent and allowed me to google simple functions such as setting
the zoom and centering locations.

There were, however, a few parts that I couldn't figure out. The first was the next and
previous chapter functions. My goal was to get "nextChapter()" working first since I only
had to follow along with the video and then move onto "previousChapter()" but I never got
"nextChapter()" to work. I tried debugging in the console and following the journey by
stepping into the function but to no avail. I plan to ask a friend or two for help. If they
can't help in time, I'll fix it after the due date.
